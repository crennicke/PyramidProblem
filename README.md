# PyramidProblem
Fetch Rewards

Hello there!

I'm going to be honest and tell you that I've never made a Web Service before.  I spent a lot of time researching and figuring out how to implement the server, but in all honesty, I spent more time just trying to get the server to run than I actually spent coding or thinking of the problem.  It was really good fun to research and learn how to implement a Web Service, and I got it running a little bit in Eclipse but it never really worked fully.  So I included four files so far in this repository.  

I have the Pyramid.java which is just a normal Java file that you can compile in your terminal or in your IDE, like Eclipse.  It contains almost the exact same code as the other Java files, but in a way that can easily be accessed to address the problem: is *insert word here* a pyramid word?  I also have the Operations.java which was the Web Service class that I never got to work with the HTTPS.  Finally I have the Servlet.java and the index.jsp files, which were intended to use as a outlet for the user to have as an HTML input and a Java class working in the background.

I'm including all of it so that you can see my process and how I intended to do all of this.  I'm sorry if this isn't what you asked for, but I'm assuming that since I don't have a public server that anyone can access, the Java files or the intended algorithim is what was expected.  Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your time.  If you need to contact me, please email rennickecharlie@gmail.com.

Sincerely,

Charlie Rennicke
