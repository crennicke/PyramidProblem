# PyramidProblem
Fetch Rewards

Hello there!

For starters, I included the Java file for the web service, Operations.java.  In that file is the methods and web code that I use
to solve the pyramid problem.  It must be launched from a server for it to work, and in that case you can use Apache Tomcat or Glassfish.
